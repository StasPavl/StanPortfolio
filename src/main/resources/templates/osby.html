                    <h3>Java Developer</h3>
                    I have gained expertise in Spring Framework, including Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA,
                    Hibernate ORM, and RESTful APIs using Spring Web to create robust and scalable applications.
                    I have also worked extensively on securing applications with Spring Security,
                    allowing me to gain a deep understanding of best practices and security concerns.
                    Apart from my technical skills, I am passionate about outdoor activities, particularly cycling,
                    and thrive on challenging myself to achieve my goals.
                    Growing up with a math teacher and an engineer in the household sparked an early interest in problem-solving,
                    which has stayed with me throughout my career. As a result, I have a keen eye for detail,
                    and I am always looking for ways to improve my work and my team's work.
                    I am multilingual, and I enjoy learning new languages as it expands my cultural understanding and helps me create long-term friendships.
